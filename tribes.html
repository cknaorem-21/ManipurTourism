        <h3>Meitei Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            The Meitei people are primarily settled in the valleys and constitute approximately half of the total Manipuri population. Most of the rich culture of Manipur can be credited to the Meiteis. The famous Manipuri martial art Thang-ta also had its origin from the Meitei knights during the ruling of the kings. The Meiteis are also fond of horse riding. Rice, vegetables, and fish are staple food of the Manipur, and Meiteis prefer fish.

        <h3>Aimol Tribe</h3>
        <p>
            These are hilly people but recently most of them have shifted to the plains. Aimol means “mountain of crabs.” The folklore traces the Aimol ethno genesis to an uncertain cave at Khweps from which the people had been believed to have emerged out under the Earth. They practice both wet and shifting paddy cultivation in the hills. Some of the crops other than paddy are sesamum, maize, soyabean, pumpkin, gourd, ginger, tomato, chilly, and groundnut.  Most of the Aimols are now converted to Christianity and identify with the Nagas, although they may be related to the Chin-Kuki group. Due to close proximity, they are also directly influenced by the Meiteis. Some of the important festivals that are performed are (1) Lungkam ut – The stone erection festival (2) Khuong-tan– The beating drum festival (3) Lam-jir – The road construction festival, and (4) Tolai-tan– The palanquin festival.

        <b>Conclusion:</b>
        <br>
        Despite being geographically and politically divided by the landforms and the number of tribes, Manipur is strongly united by the common lifestyle followed across different tribes such as the food they eat, the core reason of the festivals they celebrate, and the bright colors in the clothes they wear. It’s enchanting to see how so many tribes stay together with so much of similarity yet stand out in some way or the other. Thus, it’s a no brainer why Manipur is named as the “Land of the jewels.”
